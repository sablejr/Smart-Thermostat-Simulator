# Smart Thermostat Simulator (C#/.NET + SQLite)
A lightweight simulation of a smart thermostat device, built using C#, .NET, and SQLite.

## Features
- Adjustable target temperature
- Simulated heating/cooling behavior
- Temperature logs stored in SQLite
- Console interface for interacting with the device
- Demonstrates concepts used in IoT and smart home systems

## Tech Used
- C# (.NET 8)
- SQLite via Microsoft.Data.Sqlite
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Simple device simulation logic
- SQL data persistence

## Why I Built This
To explore concepts used in IoT and HVAC automation platforms like Alarm.com:
- device state modeling  
- backend logic  
- data logging  
- simple analytics  
- C# application structure  

## Future Improvements
- REST API version
- Web dashboard UI
- HVAC efficiency analytics
